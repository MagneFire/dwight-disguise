## How to install

Firstly you'll need to clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MagneFire/dwight-disguise.git
cd dwight-disguise
```
Then depending on the USB mode of your watch you can either chose to install using Developer or ADB mode.

To install using Developer mode use the command:
```bash
./push.sh
```

To install using ADB mode use the command:
```bash
./push.sh adb
```

## Tired of Dwight?

How can you ever be tired of Dwight!? Anyway, to use your own animated `gifs` all you have to do is replace/add them to the `dwight-disguise` folder. Then just repeat the `push.sh` command from the install instructions, you may need to remove the previous images from the watch.
